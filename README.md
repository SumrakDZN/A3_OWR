## Welcome to official development repository of Arma 3: Original War!
*If you are interested in helping out development of Arma 3: Original War, you are on the right place. Where to start?*

## Why I decided to go this way?
Arma 3: Original War has grew up into quite a big project that covers a lot of parts of Arma 3. In many of these, I am rather beginner. With this, I am trying to make anyones possible involment in the development of Arma 3: Original War as easy as possible. So if you like the idea of this modification and want to contribute to it, this is your chance! :)

## What this repository contains?
This repository contains all important gameplay source files, but does not contain files for Pliocen map, map objects and sounds.
* **owr\buildings\** all build-able structures, their model and game configs
* **owr\characters\** personnel-related configs
* **owr\data\** core config
* **owr\missions\** missions with core scripts (most of the functionality is still written inside mission for easier development)
* **owr\scripts\** contains mostly state machines that are running on buildings and vehicles (and also necessary overrides of a3 functions)
* **owr\ui\** GUI-related data and configs
* **owr\vehicles\** models, model configs, game configs for ALL vehicles
* **owr\weapons\** all weapon configuration and overrides

## What can I do with data available here?
All files, available in this repository, are for personal use only (and for use within Arma 3: Original War of course), meaning you cannot use any of these within your own work directly. If you are here just to check how I did x and y, I have absolutely no problem with that (part of the reason why this repository exists). However any help with improving Arma 3: Original War is greatly appereaciated!

## Got any questions?

*Thank you for having interest in Arma 3: Original War.*
